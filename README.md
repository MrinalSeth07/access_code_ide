- Component-driven UI with TailwindCSS & shadcn-ui  
- Monaco Editor for in-browser coding  
- Global Audio Controller (Web Speech API + server fallback)  
- Next.js/Vite routing (depending on setup)

### Backend (FastAPI)
- `/api/run` → Executes code via Piston or configurable sandbox  
- `/api/tts` → Generates/serves TTS audio (optional)  
- `/api/projects` → CRUD for projects  
- `/api/auth` → Authentication & user management  
- `/api/users` → Profiles, usage, and subscription state

### Execution Engine
- **Piston API** (or self-hosted Piston) for sandboxed code execution (Python / JS / C++)

### Database & Cache
- PostgreSQL for persistent data (users, projects, usage)  
- Redis for caching, rate-limits, and ephemeral data (optional)

### Storage
- S3 / Supabase Storage for large assets, project zips, and audio files
